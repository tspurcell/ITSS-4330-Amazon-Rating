        review_text: 'Alexandre Dumas 1844 novel The Three Musketeers is the most well-known swashbuckling novel in the genre, and with good reason. This well-deserved classic is a lot of fun, and the adventures of dArtagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are very enjoyable. There are a couple of small issues I have with the story, but its well worth reading.',

They did not like the narrators snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words. This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children. A bust for us.',

Seems like it was written for a preteen audience. I must be missing something. Read 2/3 and couldnt stand it and put it away. I can read long books but this lost my interest.',

I finally just gave up after reading a good two-thirds of it. It was just too archaic, too dull, too slow for me. Surely it would be more interesting in the original language.',
